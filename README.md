# Schedule
Program to schedule tasks relative to x amount of available time.

# Usecase

I use this program to help schedule my time into timetables, allowing me to be time efficient/aware of my time. For example, if I happen to be in the library today for x amount of time, I'll create a timetable called "library" and schedule tasks relative to the amount of time I'm spending in the library.I can then alter the average ratio of each task time to prioritise and spend more time/less time on certain tasks.

It allows me to be as rigid or as flexible as I want. For example If I have an unexpected amount of free time in a day, I can quicly schedule that time with tasks I want to do. Or be as rigid as I want, and create timetables in advance, such as a "morning routine" timetable.

The program then writes the schedule to a textfile to be viewed at any time.

# Usage
    If Run without arguments "./schedule" then will output:
    ./schedule <schedule_name> <hh:mm> <divisor>


# Improvements
1.Sorting and re-ordering of list feature
2.Annotate and clean up some of the code
3.Different Ratio altering options.
